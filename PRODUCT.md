## Users

Loupe is primarily for developers reviewing agent-generated changes locally. It should also feel polished and trustworthy enough for broader team adoption.

## Product Purpose

Loupe makes focused code review practical inside a local agent workflow: inspect a live Git comparison, attach comments to exact code, return structured feedback to the agent, refresh the resulting edit, resolve threads, and approve the review.

## Positioning

Loupe turns a local Git diff into a durable human review loop with agent-ready feedback. It stays local, anchors comments to code context, and supports repeated feedback and rereview without requiring a forge, account, database, or hosted AI service.

## Operating Context

Users launch Loupe from a Git repository, review in a browser on localhost, and hand feedback to Codex, Claude Code, or another coding agent. The core ritual is inspect, comment, return feedback, refresh, resolve, and approve.

## Capabilities and Constraints

- Preserve the current review workflow, keyboard shortcuts, review states, browse mode, durable Review Records, agent handoff, unified and side-by-side diffs, line wrapping, inline and file comments, and live refresh.
- Bun remains the runtime, server, test runner, and TypeScript executor.
- The Preact and htm frontend remains buildless, with no JSX, bundler, or transpilation step.
- The product and documentation site must share one brand and design system while remaining independently deployable static surfaces.
- Existing contracts in `src/types.ts` remain the single source of truth.

## Brand Commitments

- Keep the lowercase name `loupe`.
- Replace the inherited ADO and Claude-inspired visual themes with a distinct Loupe identity.
- Use the proof desk / redline galley direction: code is the proof, comments are anchored editorial judgment, and the feedback bundle is the marked-up return.
- Ship complete light and dark modes rather than multiple novelty themes.
- Keep the app compact and code-first; brand expression must not compete with the diff.

## Evidence on Hand

- Product behavior and constraints: `CONTEXT.md`, `docs/prompt.md`, and `AGENTS.md`.
- Existing application implementation: `src/client/`.
- Existing marketing and documentation surfaces: `site/`.
- Existing screenshots and walkthrough media: `docs/screenshots/` and locally generated `site/shots/`.
- No external testimonials, customer logos, or performance claims are available and none should be fabricated.

## Product Principles

1. Keep the diff central and the interface subordinate to close reading.
2. Make review progress, comment status, and the next action immediately legible.
3. Treat keyboard, pointer, and narrow-screen workflows as complete experiences.
4. Preserve local-first trust: clear state, durable records, and no hidden external dependency.
5. Use one coherent visual language across the app, marketing page, and docs.

## Accessibility & Inclusion

Keyboard navigation, visible focus, reduced motion, non-color state cues, and accessible contrast are required for the redesigned interface. A formal conformance target remains an open decision.
