        title: "Phones get one overflow menu",
        body: "Below 700px the tools collapse into a single menu with arrow-key navigation and shortcut hints, and nothing scrolls off the edge. Desktop tooltips now show each tool's key too.",

        title: "Reply in the thread, reopen after approval",

        title: "A clearer review menu",

        body: "A .review committed before you ever ran loupe used to show up as a reviewable file in branch, range, staged and browse mode — it's hidden in every mode now. loupe also keeps it out of git via .git/info/exclude instead of .gitignore, so hiding it no longer edits a tracked file mid-review.",

        title: "Giant files load on demand",
